# pydhc
## Rationale
There does not seem to be any permissively licenced drill hole compositing software in python.

pydhc is a MIT licenced open source one function utility that (currently) composites geophysical data to a set of intervals.


## Installation
Installation is simple
```pip install git+https://github.com/FractalGeoAnalytics/pydhc```
